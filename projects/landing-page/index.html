          <p>Here's the heroic plumber you know and love! 
            The main protector of the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario is <em>always</em> ready to fight for Princess Peach.
            He is the brother of Luigi.
            Bowser, the king of the Koopas, is no match for Mario, especially when he teams up with his friends!</p>

            Although not as brave as Mario, Luigi still manages to fight his way through haunted mansions.
            He is the taller of the two heroic brothers.
            Teamed up with his brother Mario, there's <em>nothing</em> he can't do!

          <p>The beloved princess of the Mushroom Kingdom.
            No damsel in distress here! 
            Princess Peach is capable of attacking enemies with turnips and pans and can hover over <em>very far</em> distances with her iconic dress.
            She is dedicated to serving and protecting the citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom and calls on Mario to help her once in a while.

            He, his son, the Koopalings, and <em><strong>all</strong></em> of his minions are out to get Mario and friends so he can take over the Mushroom Kingdom!
